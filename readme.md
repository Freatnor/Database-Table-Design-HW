> ***Note:*** _You can work together, but everyone must submit their own database diagram_

## Exercise

It's time to put your database design skills to work! Draw out a diagram of at least 3 database tables you would use in a banking app. The required tables are Accounts, Users, and Transactions.

#### Requirements

- Draw a diagram of at least 3 tables as described above
- Include table names, column names, and data type for each column

**Bonus:**
- Add more tables
- Indicate the relationships between tables
- Indicate which columns are primary keys and which are foreign keys (bonus because we haven't discussed this concept yet)

#### Deliverable

A pull request which includes a diagram, hand drawn or made on the computer. If you draw it by hand on paper or whiteboard, upload a picture to your repository. If you want to create it electronically, copy an image or PDF of your diagram to your repository.

#### Additional Resources

If you want to make your diagram on the computer (not required) try [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/) and select "Entity Relation" from the menu on the left.
